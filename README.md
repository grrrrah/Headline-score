# Headline-score

This project uses data scrpped from links coming from tweets. The script which does the scraping is available under news_scrape.py. Usually news outlets post a link to the certain piece of news oh which the tweet contains a short summary. 
Parts of this data can be made available on demand as my project uses a large amount of data and cannot be uploaded here. The methods used in order to calculate a presupposed relevance
of the headline to the content of the news is available here.
