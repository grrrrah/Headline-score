In a set of tables in the final pages of the jobs numbers, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the number of jobs gained or lost in each industry, broken down in a fairly fine-grained way.Across dozens and dozens of industries, only one added a meaningful number of jobs in April: general merchandise stores, including warehouse clubs and supercenters. They increased their payrolls by 93,400 positions.That makes sense given Americans need to buy groceries and other at-home staples, and Walmart has said publicly that it is hiring on a large scale to meet demand.There were a few other sectors with very narrowly positive numbers, including manufacturers of computers and peripherals (employment up 800), monetary authorities (up 100, not very many considering the trillions of dollars in assets the Federal Reserve is buying to stimulate the economy), and the U.S. Postal Service (up 500).\\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\\nTracking the high coronavirus toll in U.S. nursing homes.\\nThe virus has cost President Trump seniors’ support, and the pandemic is increasingly political.\\nThe F.D.A. approves the first antigen test for detecting the virus.\\nSee more updates\\nUpdated 2h ago\\nMore live coverage:\\nGlobal\\nMarkets\\nNew York\\nBut Walmart and a few odd exceptions aside, there was no shelter in the storm for American workers in the last month. Anyone still thinking that the pandemic’s economic effects are limited to people in restaurants, travel and similar service businesses is very much mistaken. Workers in almost every industry, including those that on the surface shouldn’t be affected by the pandemic at all, are at risk.We’re all vulnerable, whether we work in an office or a factory or a construction site; whether our employer is public or private; whether our work can easily be migrated to a home office or not.Construction employment fell by 975,000. Manufacturing fell by 1.3</td>\n",

       "      <td>half a century, in good economic times and bad, health care jobs in the United States just kept increasing. Economists and health analysts thought of them as nearly recession-proof: a buffer against the business cycle.But like so many other patterns, the coronavirus pandemic has broken this relationship. With the virus and its fallout deterring Americans from using the health system, health care jobs started being cut in March and plummeted last month with a loss of more than 1.4 million positions.“This is a disruption unlike any we’ve seen in decades,” said Ani Turner, the co-director of sustainable health spending strategies at the Altarum Institute, which tracks trends in health care spending and employment. Ms. Turner recently wrote an essay titled “Health Sector Won’t Be the Backstop in This Downturn.”A sudden drop in health spending and employment amid a pandemic that is overloading hospitals with sick patients might seem like a paradox. But it reflects how the health industry tends to make its money: Treating patients for a deadly illness is far less profitable than offering them elective surgeries. When the federal government asked hospitals to stop such procedures to free up capacity, that changed their economics profoundly.\\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\\nTracking the high coronavirus toll in U.S. nursing homes.\\nThe virus has cost President Trump seniors’ support, and the pandemic is increasingly political.\\nThe F.D.A. approves the first antigen test for detecting the virus.\\nSee more updates\\nUpdated 2h ago\\nMore live coverage:\\nGlobal\\nMarkets\\nNew York\\nAnd even if various governments across the nation hadn’t then ordered such a pause, many patients would have probably avoided doctors’ offices and hospitals to lessen the risk of contracting the coronavirus. Independent medical practices have seen huge reductions in their business, as some patients connect with doctors virtually, while many others patient visits have simply vanished.In previous recessions, the health industry has not taken such a hit. Because most Americans have health insurance, health services are more insulated from the business cycle than other kinds of spending. The biggest users of the system are older Americans. Besides being likelier to have health problems, they also tend to have comprehensive insurance coverage through Medicare and a stable source of income from Social Security. The Medicaid program, which is structured to allow people to enroll when their incomes fall, tends to offer access to health care for the poor, even if their jobs disappear.And, of course, many of the problems that</td>\n",

She doesn’t want to be “skinny.” Just able to move around more easily.“I want to walk a certain distance without getting out of breath,” said Ms. Coleman, 32, who works in attorney recruiting at a Manhattan law firm. “I want to walk around New York in the summer without sweating to death. I’d like to climb Machu Picchu.”It’s an issue she regularly wrestles with. As someone who supports size acceptance — the rights of all people to not be judged for weighing as much or as little as they want — Ms. Coleman wonders: Is it OK to rail against fat discrimination but still want to lose weight? Or does that make her part of the problem? “I’ve had people question whether I truly love myself if I want to be thinner,” she said.Her feelings are similar to those expressed by the author Roxane Gay, who once weighed 577 pounds and has discussed her own ambivalence about weight loss. “I worried that people would think I betrayed fat positivity, something I do very much believe in, even if I can’t always believe in it for myself,” she wrote in a 2018 essay on Medium, after admitting that she had undergone weight loss surgery. “I worried that everyone who responded so generously to my memoir, ‘Hunger,’ would feel betrayed. I worried I would be seen as betraying myself.”The core argument of the body positivity movement is that intentional weight loss doesn’t work and, in fact, causes more harm than good. In an effort to try to attain some impossible standard of beauty, the thinking goes, people end up with lasting emotional and physical damage that sabotages any efforts to lose weight and could even cause early death.Studies back this up: Most weight-loss efforts are ineffective in the long term and can lead to weight cycling, a risk factor for hypertension and diabetes, among other health problems. According to a 2015 report in the American Journal of Public Health, the probability of an obese person ever attaining a normal body weight is low; most people who do lose weight gain it back within five years.And</td>\n",

Andrew M. Cuomo said.It is the first known death in New York believed to be related to the mysterious new syndrome, which officials said began appearing in recent weeks.Mr. Cuomo said Friday that 73 children in the New York area had been reported to be afflicted with the illness, which doctors have labeled “pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.” He said the state Health Department was investigating whether other deaths of children were caused by the syndrome.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/1:41-1:41transcript‘Every Parent’s Nightmare,’ Cuomo Says of Mysterious IllnessGov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York addressed a rare syndrome linked to the coronavirus that causes life-threatening symptoms in children.The good news about this virus was it didn’t affect children, which was taken as great news, right? Now we have a new issue that we’re looking at, which is something we’re just investigating now. But while rare, we’re seeing some cases where children affected with the Covid virus can become ill with symptoms similar to the Kawasaki disease or toxic, toxic-shock like syndrome that literally causes inflammation in their blood vessels. This past Thursday, a 5-year-old boy passed away from Covid-related complications and the State Department of Health is investigating several other cases that present similar circumstances. This would be really painful news, and would open up an entirely different chapter because I can’t tell you how many people I spoke to who took peace and solace in the fact that children were not getting infected. If you see any of the symptoms that are on the chart that your child is evidencing, caution should be taken because this is something that we’re looking at.

       "      <td>for The New York TimesBy Liz AldermanFeb. 14, 2020PARIS — The video shows footprints in blood-red paint tracked by militant protesters across BlackRock’s French headquarters. Documents litter the floors. On the walls, black spray-painted graffiti denounces the company as “criminal.”Just a few months ago, BlackRock, the U.S. money-management giant, was barely known to the general public in France. But as President Emmanuel Macron presses ahead with a controversial campaign to overhaul the French economy, the company has become a favorite target for growing anticapitalist sentiment.Protesters claim BlackRock has tried to influence — and stands to profit from — Mr. Macron’s overhaul of the nation’s pension system. They point to cordial meetings between Mr. Macron and Laurence D. Fink, the founder and chief executive of BlackRock. And they fear the huge Wall Street firm — its $7 trillion under management is more than twice France’s economic output — is working behind the scenes to pick apart the country’s system of social protections.The protests escalated with the action on Monday morning, when environmental activists who allege French workers’ pensions could be directed by BlackRock stormed the company’s offices.Last month, trade unions and members of the Yellow Vest movement led a raucous crowd to the historic Le Centorial building, where BlackRock has its offices, lighting flares and denouncing what they said was an effort to impose American-style free-market rules on France.There is no evidence that BlackRock influenced Mr. Macron to push retirement savings to it or any other financial giant, although financial firms could get some business from part of the pension overhaul that encourages high earners to invest in stocks.And BlackRock strenuously denies the claims. “We deplore the fact that our company continues to be caught up in an unfounded controversy driven by political objectives,” it said in a statement. “We reiterate that BlackRock has never been involved in the current pension reform project and does not intend to be.”Yet BlackRock’s role as an adviser to governments and central banks and as a major shareholder in some of the world’s biggest companies has quickly made it a symbol in a country that has long been deeply skeptical of capitalism and the stock market. The social climate here has grown more tense after recent nationwide strikes to protest the pension overhaul.BlackRock has tried to portray itself as an industry leader in responsible investing.

In 2016, the Perry Institute, based in Waitsfield, Vt., found reefs in the Bahamas to be under stress and classified them as impaired, the category just above poor.Healthy reefs are vital to marine ecosystems in the area, and the storm damage appears to have hit the country’s fisheries, as well. Dr. Dahlgren’s team reported a significant decline in fish populations linked to habitat damage.In addition to extremely turbulent waters, Dorian brought a surge of rainwater that changed sea salinity. The storm also caused water temperatures to fluctuate rapidly — both conditions that quite likely shocked the corals, according to researchers.But the report’s news was not all bad. “We did see some areas that came out of it looking almost untouched, amazingly,” Dr. Dahlgren said. “The patterns of damage that we saw were not consistent. You could have reefs that were a few miles apart. One would be totally destroyed and the other, you couldn’t even tell a hurricane was there.”Some of the fragmented corals could be regrown in nurseries and then reattached to dead pieces to replenish them. But that would take time, as some species take many years to grow.Researchers from the Perry Institute have studied reefs in the Bahamas for years. When Dorian hit, they were in position to assess the damage quickly even though boats and scientific equipment were also damaged in the storm.“This study speaks strongly to the importance of long-term monitoring,” said Kim Cobb, a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences who was not involved in the research. Coral ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change and monitoring them is crucial, she said.“Corals are early warning signs of the kind</td>\n",

       "      <td>Loureiro Fernandez for The New York TimesBy Julie TurkewitzFeb. 13, 2020BOGOTÁ, Colombia — When the leader of Venezuela’s opposition landed in Caracas this week following a world tour meant to drum up support for regime change, his country’s authoritarian ruler handed him neither an arrest, which would have galvanized supporters, nor the chance for a hero’s welcome at the airport.Instead, President Nicolás Maduro appeared to greet his rival, Juan Guaidó, with the same policy of slow strangulation that has drained the opposition of much of its momentum over the past year, cracking down on his movement enough to wear down its members, but without going so far as to spur the world to action.Moments before Mr. Guaidó arrived, Mr. Maduro’s supporters attacked journalists who were there to cover his arrival, punching them and dragging at least one woman by the hair. Once Mr. Guaidó landed, government backers chased him out of the airport, cutting off any plans he had to make a speech, and then attacked his car with traffic cones and at least one metal pole.And as Mr. Guaidó slipped through, authorities arrested his uncle, accusing him, without presenting evidence, of bringing explosives into the country.Hours later, Mr. Guaidó stood with a few hundred supporters in a plaza in an opposition stronghold in eastern Caracas and declared victory.“I defied the dictatorship and I entered the country,” he said. “Venezuela is going to be democratic and free.”ImageProtestors threw traffic cones at the car carrying Mr. Guaidó as he left the international airport in Venezuela.Credit...Matias Delacroix/Associated PressMr. Guaidó also said he would be announcing the creation of a “Venezuela Fund,” a multilateral program meant to help the country recover from its long and devastating economic crisis.[Update: The U.S. has imposed sanctions on the Russian oil company supporting Venezuela’s leader.]But he offered no other plan to remove Mr. Maduro. That, along with his chaotic arrival and the growing frustration among his base caused by the glacial pace of change, spoke eloquently about the challenges Mr. Guaidó is facing at home.On Tuesday, as Mr. Guaidó arrived in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, Mr. Maduro’s most powerful ally, Diosdado Cabello, mocked the size of the crowd that had come to receive him at the airport and belittled his movement.Mr. Guaidó issued a direct challenge to Mr. Maduro a year ago, when he pointed to irregularities in Mr. Maduro’s re-election and claimed to be the country’s interim</td>\n",

       "      <td>Dickerson and Zolan Kanno-YoungsFeb. 14, 2020The Trump administration is deploying law enforcement tactical units from the southern border as part of a supercharged arrest operation in sanctuary cities across the country, an escalation in the president’s battle against localities that refuse to participate in immigration enforcement.The specially trained officers are being sent to cities including Chicago and New York to boost the enforcement power of local Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to two officials who are familiar with the secret operation. Additional agents are expected to be sent to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, New Orleans, Detroit and Newark, N.J.The move reflects President Trump’s persistence in cracking down on so-called sanctuary cities, localities that have refused to cooperate in handing over immigrants targeted for deportation to federal authorities. It comes soon after the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security announced a series of measures that will affect both American citizens and immigrants living in those places.Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, confirmed that the agency was deploying 100 officers to work with ICE, which conducts arrests in the interior of the country, “in order to enhance the integrity of the immigration system, protect public safety, and strengthen our national security.”The deployment of the teams will run from February through May, according to an email sent to C.B.P. personnel, which was read to The New York Times by one official familiar with the planning.Among the agents being deployed to sanctuary cities are members of the elite tactical unit known as BORTAC, which acts essentially as the SWAT team of the Border Patrol. With additional gear such as stun grenades and enhanced Special Forces-type training, including sniper certification, the officers typically conduct high-risk operations targeting individuals who are known to be violent, many of them with extensive criminal records.The unit’s work often takes place in the most rugged and swelteringly hot areas of the border. It can involve breaking into stash houses maintained by smuggling operations that are known to be filled with drugs and weapons.In sanctuary cities, the BORTAC agents will be asked to support interior officers in run-of-the-mill immigration arrests, the officials said. Their presence could spark new fear in immigrant communities that have been on high alert under the stepped-up deportation and detention policies adopted after Mr. Trump took office.In a statement, ICE’s acting director, Matthew T.

       "      <td>most beloved sitcoms of the ’90s, is developing “The Nanny” into a musical bound for Broadway, the production announced on Wednesday.The TV show aired for six seasons, from 1993-1999. The nanny — Fran Fine, an over-the-top Queens native who arrives on the doorstep of a Manhattan family that happens to be looking for help — was partly based on Drescher’s own Queens upbringing.The team behind the CW musical comedy “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” will be crafting the show’s score. Rachel Bloom, who created and stars in the CW series, will write the music and lyrics for stage with Adam Schlesinger, the show’s executive music producer. The pair won an Emmy Award last year for outstanding original music and lyrics on the show.Though more and more films are being adapted to the stage, TV series rarely get the same treatment. “The Nanny” would join a slim list that includes “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical,” which opened in 2017, and “The Addams Family” from 2010. Drescher will write the book with Peter Marc Jacobson, who created and wrote the show with Drescher, who was his wife at the time. The cast has not been decided yet, the show said, but Drescher will not be reprising her role. Scott and Brian Zeilinger, the father-son producing duo whose shows include “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Mean Girls,\" are also signed on. Marc Bruni (“Beautiful: The Carole King Musical”) will direct.The show has not yet announced a production schedule.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions</td>\n",

In a set of tables in the final pages of the jobs numbers, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports the number of jobs gained or lost in each industry, broken down in a fairly fine-grained way.Across dozens and dozens of industries, only one added a meaningful number of jobs in April: general merchandise stores, including warehouse clubs and supercenters. They increased their payrolls by 93,400 positions.That makes sense given Americans need to buy groceries and other at-home staples, and Walmart has said publicly that it is hiring on a large scale to meet demand.There were a few other sectors with very narrowly positive numbers, including manufacturers of computers and peripherals (employment up 800), monetary authorities (up 100, not very many considering the trillions of dollars in assets the Federal Reserve is buying to stimulate the economy), and the U.S. Postal Service (up 500).\\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\\nTracking the high coronavirus toll in U.S. nursing homes.\\nThe virus has cost President Trump seniors’ support, and the pandemic is increasingly political.\\nThe F.D.A. approves the first antigen test for detecting the virus.\\nSee more updates\\nUpdated 2h ago\\nMore live coverage:\\nGlobal\\nMarkets\\nNew York\\nBut Walmart and a few odd exceptions aside, there was no shelter in the storm for American workers in the last month. Anyone still thinking that the pandemic’s economic effects are limited to people in restaurants, travel and similar service businesses is very much mistaken. Workers in almost every industry, including those that on the surface shouldn’t be affected by the pandemic at all, are at risk.We’re all vulnerable, whether we work in an office or a factory or a construction site; whether our employer is public or private; whether our work can easily be migrated to a home office or not.Construction employment fell by 975,000. Manufacturing fell by 1.3  \n",

Economists and health analysts thought of them as nearly recession-proof: a buffer against the business cycle.But like so many other patterns, the coronavirus pandemic has broken this relationship. With the virus and its fallout deterring Americans from using the health system, health care jobs started being cut in March and plummeted last month with a loss of more than 1.4 million positions.“This is a disruption unlike any we’ve seen in decades,” said Ani Turner, the co-director of sustainable health spending strategies at the Altarum Institute, which tracks trends in health care spending and employment. Ms. Turner recently wrote an essay titled “Health Sector Won’t Be the Backstop in This Downturn.”A sudden drop in health spending and employment amid a pandemic that is overloading hospitals with sick patients might seem like a paradox. But it reflects how the health industry tends to make its money: Treating patients for a deadly illness is far less profitable than offering them elective surgeries. When the federal government asked hospitals to stop such procedures to free up capacity, that changed their economics profoundly.\\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S.\\nTracking the high coronavirus toll in U.S. nursing homes.\\nThe virus has cost President Trump seniors’ support, and the pandemic is increasingly political.\\nThe F.D.A. approves the first antigen test for detecting the virus.\\nSee more updates\\nUpdated 2h ago\\nMore live coverage:\\nGlobal\\nMarkets\\nNew York\\nAnd even if various governments across the nation hadn’t then ordered such a pause, many patients would have probably avoided doctors’ offices and hospitals to lessen the risk of contracting the coronavirus. Independent medical practices have seen huge reductions in their business, as some patients connect with doctors virtually, while many others patient visits have simply vanished.In previous recessions, the health industry has not taken such a hit. Because most Americans have health insurance, health services are more insulated from the business cycle than other kinds of spending. The biggest users of the system are older Americans. Besides being likelier to have health problems, they also tend to have comprehensive insurance coverage through Medicare and a stable source of income from Social Security. The Medicaid program, which is structured to allow people to enroll when their incomes fall, tends to offer access to health care for the poor, even if their jobs disappear.And, of course, many of the problems that  \n",

She doesn’t want to be “skinny.” Just able to move around more easily.“I want to walk a certain distance without getting out of breath,” said Ms. Coleman, 32, who works in attorney recruiting at a Manhattan law firm. “I want to walk around New York in the summer without sweating to death. I’d like to climb Machu Picchu.”It’s an issue she regularly wrestles with. As someone who supports size acceptance — the rights of all people to not be judged for weighing as much or as little as they want — Ms. Coleman wonders: Is it OK to rail against fat discrimination but still want to lose weight? Or does that make her part of the problem? “I’ve had people question whether I truly love myself if I want to be thinner,” she said.Her feelings are similar to those expressed by the author Roxane Gay, who once weighed 577 pounds and has discussed her own ambivalence about weight loss. “I worried that people would think I betrayed fat positivity, something I do very much believe in, even if I can’t always believe in it for myself,” she wrote in a 2018 essay on Medium, after admitting that she had undergone weight loss surgery. “I worried that everyone who responded so generously to my memoir, ‘Hunger,’ would feel betrayed. I worried I would be seen as betraying myself.”The core argument of the body positivity movement is that intentional weight loss doesn’t work and, in fact, causes more harm than good. In an effort to try to attain some impossible standard of beauty, the thinking goes, people end up with lasting emotional and physical damage that sabotages any efforts to lose weight and could even cause early death.Studies back this up: Most weight-loss efforts are ineffective in the long term and can lead to weight cycling, a risk factor for hypertension and diabetes, among other health problems. According to a 2015 report in the American Journal of Public Health, the probability of an obese person ever attaining a normal body weight is low; most people who do lose weight gain it back within five years.And  \n",

Andrew M. Cuomo said.It is the first known death in New York believed to be related to the mysterious new syndrome, which officials said began appearing in recent weeks.Mr. Cuomo said Friday that 73 children in the New York area had been reported to be afflicted with the illness, which doctors have labeled “pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.” He said the state Health Department was investigating whether other deaths of children were caused by the syndrome.VideotranscriptBackbars0:00/1:41-1:41transcript‘Every Parent’s Nightmare,’ Cuomo Says of Mysterious IllnessGov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York addressed a rare syndrome linked to the coronavirus that causes life-threatening symptoms in children.The good news about this virus was it didn’t affect children, which was taken as great news, right? Now we have a new issue that we’re looking at, which is something we’re just investigating now. But while rare, we’re seeing some cases where children affected with the Covid virus can become ill with symptoms similar to the Kawasaki disease or toxic, toxic-shock like syndrome that literally causes inflammation in their blood vessels. This past Thursday, a 5-year-old boy passed away from Covid-related complications and the State Department of Health is investigating several other cases that present similar circumstances. This would be really painful news, and would open up an entirely different chapter because I can’t tell you how many people I spoke to who took peace and solace in the fact that children were not getting infected.

Documents litter the floors. On the walls, black spray-painted graffiti denounces the company as “criminal.”Just a few months ago, BlackRock, the U.S. money-management giant, was barely known to the general public in France. But as President Emmanuel Macron presses ahead with a controversial campaign to overhaul the French economy, the company has become a favorite target for growing anticapitalist sentiment.Protesters claim BlackRock has tried to influence — and stands to profit from — Mr. Macron’s overhaul of the nation’s pension system. They point to cordial meetings between Mr. Macron and Laurence D. Fink, the founder and chief executive of BlackRock. And they fear the huge Wall Street firm — its $7 trillion under management is more than twice France’s economic output — is working behind the scenes to pick apart the country’s system of social protections.The protests escalated with the action on Monday morning, when environmental activists who allege French workers’ pensions could be directed by BlackRock stormed the company’s offices.Last month, trade unions and members of the Yellow Vest movement led a raucous crowd to the historic Le Centorial building, where BlackRock has its offices, lighting flares and denouncing what they said was an effort to impose American-style free-market rules on France.There is no evidence that BlackRock influenced Mr. Macron to push retirement savings to it or any other financial giant, although financial firms could get some business from part of the pension overhaul that encourages high earners to invest in stocks.And BlackRock strenuously denies the claims. “We deplore the fact that our company continues to be caught up in an unfounded controversy driven by political objectives,” it said in a statement. “We reiterate that BlackRock has never been involved in the current pension reform project and does not intend to be.”Yet BlackRock’s role as an adviser to governments and central banks and as a major shareholder in some of the world’s biggest companies has quickly made it a symbol in a country that has long been deeply skeptical of capitalism and the stock market. The social climate here has grown more tense after recent nationwide strikes to protest the pension overhaul.BlackRock has tried to portray itself as an industry leader in responsible investing.

In 2016, the Perry Institute, based in Waitsfield, Vt., found reefs in the Bahamas to be under stress and classified them as impaired, the category just above poor.Healthy reefs are vital to marine ecosystems in the area, and the storm damage appears to have hit the country’s fisheries, as well. Dr. Dahlgren’s team reported a significant decline in fish populations linked to habitat damage.In addition to extremely turbulent waters, Dorian brought a surge of rainwater that changed sea salinity. The storm also caused water temperatures to fluctuate rapidly — both conditions that quite likely shocked the corals, according to researchers.But the report’s news was not all bad. “We did see some areas that came out of it looking almost untouched, amazingly,” Dr. Dahlgren said. “The patterns of damage that we saw were not consistent. You could have reefs that were a few miles apart. One would be totally destroyed and the other, you couldn’t even tell a hurricane was there.”Some of the fragmented corals could be regrown in nurseries and then reattached to dead pieces to replenish them. But that would take time, as some species take many years to grow.Researchers from the Perry Institute have studied reefs in the Bahamas for years. When Dorian hit, they were in position to assess the damage quickly even though boats and scientific equipment were also damaged in the storm.“This study speaks strongly to the importance of long-term monitoring,” said Kim Cobb, a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology’s School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences who was not involved in the research. Coral ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate change and monitoring them is crucial, she said.“Corals are early warning signs of the kind  \n",

Once Mr. Guaidó landed, government backers chased him out of the airport, cutting off any plans he had to make a speech, and then attacked his car with traffic cones and at least one metal pole.And as Mr. Guaidó slipped through, authorities arrested his uncle, accusing him, without presenting evidence, of bringing explosives into the country.Hours later, Mr. Guaidó stood with a few hundred supporters in a plaza in an opposition stronghold in eastern Caracas and declared victory.“I defied the dictatorship and I entered the country,” he said. “Venezuela is going to be democratic and free.”ImageProtestors threw traffic cones at the car carrying Mr. Guaidó as he left the international airport in Venezuela.Credit...Matias Delacroix/Associated PressMr. Guaidó also said he would be announcing the creation of a “Venezuela Fund,” a multilateral program meant to help the country recover from its long and devastating economic crisis.[Update: The U.S. has imposed sanctions on the Russian oil company supporting Venezuela’s leader.]But he offered no other plan to remove Mr. Maduro. That, along with his chaotic arrival and the growing frustration among his base caused by the glacial pace of change, spoke eloquently about the challenges Mr. Guaidó is facing at home.On Tuesday, as Mr. Guaidó arrived in Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, Mr. Maduro’s most powerful ally, Diosdado Cabello, mocked the size of the crowd that had come to receive him at the airport and belittled his movement.Mr. Guaidó issued a direct challenge to Mr. Maduro a year ago, when he pointed to irregularities in Mr. Maduro’s re-election and claimed to be the country’s interim  \n",
       "4468  Dickerson and Zolan Kanno-YoungsFeb. 14, 2020The Trump administration is deploying law enforcement tactical units from the southern border as part of a supercharged arrest operation in sanctuary cities across the country, an escalation in the president’s battle against localities that refuse to participate in immigration enforcement.The specially trained officers are being sent to cities including Chicago and New York to boost the enforcement power of local Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to two officials who are familiar with the secret operation. Additional agents are expected to be sent to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, New Orleans, Detroit and Newark, N.J.The move reflects President Trump’s persistence in cracking down on so-called sanctuary cities, localities that have refused to cooperate in handing over immigrants targeted for deportation to federal authorities. It comes soon after the Justice Department and Department of Homeland Security announced a series of measures that will affect both American citizens and immigrants living in those places.Lawrence Payne, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, confirmed that the agency was deploying 100 officers to work with ICE, which conducts arrests in the interior of the country, “in order to enhance the integrity of the immigration system, protect public safety, and strengthen our national security.”The deployment of the teams will run from February through May, according to an email sent to C.B.P. personnel, which was read to The New York Times by one official familiar with the planning.Among the agents being deployed to sanctuary cities are members of the elite tactical unit known as BORTAC, which acts essentially as the SWAT team of the Border Patrol. With additional gear such as stun grenades and enhanced Special Forces-type training, including sniper certification, the officers typically conduct high-risk operations targeting individuals who are known to be violent, many of them with extensive criminal records.The unit’s work often takes place in the most rugged and swelteringly hot areas of the border. It can involve breaking into stash houses maintained by smuggling operations that are known to be filled with drugs and weapons.In sanctuary cities, the BORTAC agents will be asked to support interior officers in run-of-the-mill immigration arrests, the officials said. Their presence could spark new fear in immigrant communities that have been on high alert under the stepped-up deportation and detention policies adopted after Mr. Trump took office.In a statement, ICE’s acting director, Matthew T.

The nanny — Fran Fine, an over-the-top Queens native who arrives on the doorstep of a Manhattan family that happens to be looking for help — was partly based on Drescher’s own Queens upbringing.The team behind the CW musical comedy “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” will be crafting the show’s score. Rachel Bloom, who created and stars in the CW series, will write the music and lyrics for stage with Adam Schlesinger, the show’s executive music producer. The pair won an Emmy Award last year for outstanding original music and lyrics on the show.Though more and more films are being adapted to the stage, TV series rarely get the same treatment. “The Nanny” would join a slim list that includes “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Broadway Musical,” which opened in 2017, and “The Addams Family” from 2010. Drescher will write the book with Peter Marc Jacobson, who created and wrote the show with Drescher, who was his wife at the time. The cast has not been decided yet, the show said, but Drescher will not be reprising her role. Scott and Brian Zeilinger, the father-son producing duo whose shows include “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Mean Girls,\" are also signed on. Marc Bruni (“Beautiful: The Carole King Musical”) will direct.The show has not yet announced a production schedule.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions  \n",

       "      <td>time as defense secretary, when he oversaw the last bloody years of the country’s civil war.Credit...Dinuka Liyanawatte/ReutersBy Maria Abi-Habib and Dharisha BastiansMarch 28, 2020Sri Lanka’s president has pardoned a soldier who was sentenced to death for killing eight civilians during the country’s civil war, leading to accusations that the government was taking advantage of the chaos from the coronavirus pandemic to free a wartime ally accused of atrocities.The pardon reverses one of the very few convictions from the 26-year civil war, during which dozens of militants and military officers were accused of war crimes. The pardoned soldier, former Staff Sgt.

Three of the victims were children.The pardon brought outrage from rights activists and opposition politicians, but little obvious reaction from the broader Sri Lankan public, which is under a strict curfew in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa instructed the Ministry of Justice to release Mr. Ratnayake from prison on Thursday. Mr. Rajapaksa, who was elected in November, is himself accused of having ordered war crimes during the civil war, when he served as defense secretary.The Sri Lankan government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The United Nations called the pardon an “affront to victims” and another example of Sri Lanka’s failure to hold war criminals to account.\\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak\\nThree top U.S. health officials will quarantine after White House staff members tested positive.\\nA new cluster in China highlights the challenge of controlling infections as countries open up.\\nThe U.F.C. made its return, the first major U.S. sporting event to take place in weeks.\\nSee more updates\\nUpdated 19m ago\\nMore live coverage:\\nMarkets\\nU.S.\\nNew York\\n“This was one of the rare human rights cases from the decades-long conflict that had ever reached conviction,” a spokesman for the U.N.

As the virus hit, “economic activity in the EU dropped by around one third practically overnight,\" he said.\\nMore than 1.1 million people have contracted the virus across Europe and over 137,000 have died, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Unclear outbreak data, low testing rates and the strain on health care systems mean the true scale of the pandemic is much greater.\\nWith the spread slowing in most European countries, people are cautiously venturing out from confinement and gradually returning to work, but strict health measures remain in place amid concern of a second wave of outbreaks and any return to something like normal life is at least months away.\\nThe pandemic has hurt consumer spending, industrial output, investment, trade, capital flows and supply chains. It has also hit jobs. The unemployment rate across the 27-nation EU is forecast to rise from 6.7% last year to 9% in 2020 but then fall to around 8% in 2021, the commission said. Beyond that, Gentiloni said, “we will have a massive drop in hours worked.\"\\nGlobally, the pandemic is expected to cause the deepest recession in living memory, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting a 3% decline this year. The UN says that is expected to cause a drop in work hours equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs.\\nInflation in Europe is also set to be significantly weaker as consumer prices fall amid a sharp weakening of demand and drop in oil prices.

But three months later in the midst of the pandemic it announced that clearing would start at the end of this week.\\nThis led to daily protests at the site, which is one of the few areas of bushland that was not burned by the Currowan fire that ripped through Conjola, Manyana, Bendalong and Sussex Inlet on 31 December and in the following days.\\nSpared by the fires, NSW's south coast bushland now faces the bulldozers\\nRead more\\nThe Greens MP David Shoebridge said Ozy Homes had begun negotiations with the Shoalhaven mayor, Amanda Findley, and state politicians and agreed to a minimum two-week halt in any works to explore good faith negotiations with the council, the community and the state government.\\nThe negotiations will seek to identify alternative options to clearing of the Manyana site, he said.\\nOptions being discussed are alternative “like for like” development sites that would enable similar developments, including a site at Nowra.\\n“This is a win for the community, for native flora and fauna and for common sense,” Shoebridge said.\\n“I appreciate the developer responding to the community’s concerns, stepping back and seeking to find a negotiated outcome that protects the forest,” he said.\\nHe congratulated the community</td>\n",

Close to 30 people in one department alone had symptoms — dry, deep coughs and fevers they could not shake. When they gradually returned to work after taking sick days, they sat in their cubicles looking wan and tired.“I’ve started to think it was the coronavirus,” said Julie Parks, a 63-year-old employee who was among the sick. “I may have had it, but I can’t be sure. It’s limbo.”The revelation this week that a death in the United States in early February was the result of the coronavirus has significantly altered the understanding of how early the virus may have been circulating in this country. Researchers now believe that hidden outbreaks were creeping through cities like Chicago, New York, Seattle and Boston in January and February, earlier than previously known.The new timeline has lent credence to a question on the minds of many Americans: Did I already have the coronavirus?The retroactive search is happening on many levels. People who had suffered dreadful bouts with flulike illnesses are now wondering whether it had been the coronavirus. Doctors are thinking back to unexplained cases. Medical examiners are poring over their records looking for possible misdiagnosed deaths. And local politicians are demanding investigations.Brian Gustafson, a coroner in Rock Island County, Ill., said he had no capability to perform post-mortem coronavirus tests, but firmly believed that coronavirus deaths and illnesses were missed across the country during weeks, early this year, when the authorities believed the virus was mainly overseas.Included in Mr. Gustafson’s suspicions of an undercount: himself. He is convinced that he had the coronavirus in January, when he was so crushingly tired and feverish, he could scarcely summon the strength to walk to the bathroom from his bed.“I think it was here long before we knew it,” said Mr. Gustafson, who is also a nurse and said he believes that he contracted the virus from one of the recently deceased people who was brought to the coroner’s office long before anyone in Illinois was looking for positive coronavirus cases. “That’s the only logical thing I can think of.”ImageSeattle residents were mostly hunkered down in their homes by</td>\n",

He also pleaded to one count of using fire to commit a felony, which has a possible 10-year sentence. He entered the pleas in federal court in Lafayette.

The pardoned soldier, former Staff Sgt. Sunil Ratnayake, was sentenced in 2015 for blindfolding eight civilians from the Tamil ethnic group, slitting their throats and dumping their bodies into a sewer in 2000. Three of the victims were children.The pardon brought outrage from rights activists and opposition politicians, but little obvious reaction from the broader Sri Lankan public, which is under a strict curfew in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus.President Gotabaya Rajapaksa instructed the Ministry of Justice to release Mr. Ratnayake from prison on Thursday. Mr. Rajapaksa, who was elected in November, is himself accused of having ordered war crimes during the civil war, when he served as defense secretary.The Sri Lankan government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The United Nations called the pardon an “affront to victims” and another example of Sri Lanka’s failure to hold war criminals to account.\\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak\\nThree top U.S. health officials will quarantine after White House staff members tested positive.\\nA new cluster in China highlights the challenge of controlling infections as countries open up.\\nThe U.F.C. made its return, the first major U.S. sporting event to take place in weeks.\\nSee more updates\\nUpdated 19m ago\\nMore live coverage:\\nMarkets\\nU.S.\\nNew York\\n“This was one of the rare human rights cases from the decades-long conflict that had ever reached conviction,” a spokesman for the U.N.

As the virus hit, “economic activity in the EU dropped by around one third practically overnight,\" he said.\\nMore than 1.1 million people have contracted the virus across Europe and over 137,000 have died, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Unclear outbreak data, low testing rates and the strain on health care systems mean the true scale of the pandemic is much greater.\\nWith the spread slowing in most European countries, people are cautiously venturing out from confinement and gradually returning to work, but strict health measures remain in place amid concern of a second wave of outbreaks and any return to something like normal life is at least months away.\\nThe pandemic has hurt consumer spending, industrial output, investment, trade, capital flows and supply chains. It has also hit jobs. The unemployment rate across the 27-nation EU is forecast to rise from 6.7% last year to 9% in 2020 but then fall to around 8% in 2021, the commission said. Beyond that, Gentiloni said, “we will have a massive drop in hours worked.\"\\nGlobally, the pandemic is expected to cause the deepest recession in living memory, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting a 3% decline this year. The UN says that is expected to cause a drop in work hours equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs.\\nInflation in Europe is also set to be significantly weaker as consumer prices fall amid a sharp weakening of demand and drop in oil prices.

But three months later in the midst of the pandemic it announced that clearing would start at the end of this week.\\nThis led to daily protests at the site, which is one of the few areas of bushland that was not burned by the Currowan fire that ripped through Conjola, Manyana, Bendalong and Sussex Inlet on 31 December and in the following days.\\nSpared by the fires, NSW's south coast bushland now faces the bulldozers\\nRead more\\nThe Greens MP David Shoebridge said Ozy Homes had begun negotiations with the Shoalhaven mayor, Amanda Findley, and state politicians and agreed to a minimum two-week halt in any works to explore good faith negotiations with the council, the community and the state government.\\nThe negotiations will seek to identify alternative options to clearing of the Manyana site, he said.\\nOptions being discussed are alternative “like for like” development sites that would enable similar developments, including a site at Nowra.\\n“This is a win for the community, for native flora and fauna and for common sense,” Shoebridge said.\\n“I appreciate the developer responding to the community’s concerns, stepping back and seeking to find a negotiated outcome that protects the forest,” he said.\\nHe congratulated the community  \n",

Close to 30 people in one department alone had symptoms — dry, deep coughs and fevers they could not shake. When they gradually returned to work after taking sick days, they sat in their cubicles looking wan and tired.“I’ve started to think it was the coronavirus,” said Julie Parks, a 63-year-old employee who was among the sick. “I may have had it, but I can’t be sure. It’s limbo.”The revelation this week that a death in the United States in early February was the result of the coronavirus has significantly altered the understanding of how early the virus may have been circulating in this country. Researchers now believe that hidden outbreaks were creeping through cities like Chicago, New York, Seattle and Boston in January and February, earlier than previously known.The new timeline has lent credence to a question on the minds of many Americans: Did I already have the coronavirus?The retroactive search is happening on many levels. People who had suffered dreadful bouts with flulike illnesses are now wondering whether it had been the coronavirus. Doctors are thinking back to unexplained cases. Medical examiners are poring over their records looking for possible misdiagnosed deaths. And local politicians are demanding investigations.Brian Gustafson, a coroner in Rock Island County, Ill., said he had no capability to perform post-mortem coronavirus tests, but firmly believed that coronavirus deaths and illnesses were missed across the country during weeks, early this year, when the authorities believed the virus was mainly overseas.Included in Mr. Gustafson’s suspicions of an undercount: himself. He is convinced that he had the coronavirus in January, when he was so crushingly tired and feverish, he could scarcely summon the strength to walk to the bathroom from his bed.“I think it was here long before we knew it,” said Mr. Gustafson, who is also a nurse and said he believes that he contracted the virus from one of the recently deceased people who was brought to the coroner’s office long before anyone in Illinois was looking for positive coronavirus cases. “That’s the only logical thing I can think of.”ImageSeattle residents were mostly hunkered down in their homes by  \n",

Holden Matthews, 22, admitted he set the fires to raise his profile as an aspiring \"black metal\" musician, the U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement.\\nThe statement from federal prosecutors said that Matthews pleaded guilty to three counts of intentional damage to religious property, a federal hate crime carrying a possible 20-year sentence per count. He also pleaded to one count of using fire to commit a felony, which has a possible 10-year sentence. He entered the pleas in federal court in Lafayette. Three churches were burned in a span of 10 days, beginning in late March 2019, in an area roughly 140 miles west of New Orleans in St. Landry Parish.\\nHolden Matthews\\nWWLTV\\nMatthews is white, and the destruction of the three historic black churches evoked memories of civil rights-era terrorism.

U.S. exports fell 9.6% to $187.7 billion on plunging orders for cars, auto parts and industrial machines. Imports fell 6.2% to $232.2 billion.\\nTotal trade — exports plus imports — came in at $419.9 billion in March, down 7.8% from February and 11.4% from March 2019.\\nThe politically sensitive deficit in the trade of goods with China fell 21.3% to $15.5 billion in March as exports rose slightly and imports plummeted.\\nThe coronavirus and the lockdowns and travel restrictions meant to contain it have hammered the world economy and paralyzed global trade.\\nIn March, the United States ran a $21.2 billion surplus in the trade of services such as tourism and banking. But it registered a $65.6 billion deficit in the trade of goods such as cars and appliances.Comments (0)Share to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this articleTop StoriesUS trade gap rises to $44.4 billlion as virus slams commerceMay 05, 6:35 PM'Siegfried and Roy' tiger grabs Roy  \n",
